# Project Roadmap: Cubs vs. White Sox Simulation

## Timeline: 5 Weeks

---

### Week 1: Project Planning & Setup
- Define scope and deliverables
- Set up project folder structure
- Gather historical Cubs and White Sox run data
- Clean and preprocess run data
- Draft Functional Specs, Product Backlog, Roadmap

---

### Week 2: Core Simulation Logic
- Implement basic Monte Carlo engine
- Generate win probabilities and average score estimates
- Validate output with test cases
- Create base visualization (score histograms)
- Begin functional testing

---

### Week 3: Output & Reporting
- Save outputs to structured files (PNG, TXT, CSV)
- Add implied betting odds feature
- Modularize code into functional units
- Save results in `/results/` folder
- Finalize core simulation script

---

### Week 4: Documentation & Enhancements
- Populate all PM documentation (WBS, Status Log, Backlog updates)
- Add optional enhancements (margin of victory, context flags)
- Test full repo for reproducibility
- Review output clarity and file naming

---

### Week 5: Final Packaging & Presentation
- Polish README.md with run instructions
- Ensure repo meets all structure guidelines
- Review, test, and zip for final submission
- Present roadmap, specs, results, and code during review

---

## Future (Optional)
- Add web-based dashboard for interactive simulations
- Integrate with real-time data feeds (pitchers, weather)
- Support simulations for full MLB season outcomes
